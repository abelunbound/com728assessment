    In each case, with the exception of the setup_database function, the result of executing relevant database function
    should be displayed using the appropriate tui function.
    For example,
        The result of executing the retrieve_customers_alphabetically function should be displayed using the tui
        display_records function.

    If the action is invalid then the error message 'Invalid selection.' should be displayed using the tui error
    function.
